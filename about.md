# About

My Name is Dharam Singh Meena. I am Final year student at NIT Delhi, India. I am currently pursuing my graduation in computer science. 

In these years, I have learnt my different things and tried to implement them in various ways. Through creating personal projects and through internships.

So here, It is a just a way to validate the things i have learnt by posting them and organizing them. I also like to write posts on topics that can probably help someone in future.

This is a Blog cum portfolio.
