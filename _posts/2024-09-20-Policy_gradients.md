In this blog, we will discuss about the policy and policy gradients in reinforcement learning.

# Policy 🎮

The algorithm a software agent uses to determine it’s actions is called it’s policy. The goal of the agent is to learn a policy that maximizes its reward over time. 🎯

There are several types of policies:

1. Deterministic policies 🔒: 
These directly map states to actions
2. Stochastic policies 🎲: 
These map states to probability distributions over actions. An action is randomly chosen based on the probability distribution, and it's not necessary for the agent to always choose the action with the highest probability. This type of policy involves some randomness.

This distinction between deterministic and stochastic policies is an important concept in reinforcement learning and policy-based methods. 🧠




# Policy Gradients

Policy gradients is a type of reinforcement learning algorithm where the agent learns to make decisions based on a policy, which is a mapping from states to actions. [In naive terms, improves its policy by playing, using gradient descent  & discounted rewards] 

This method is useful for problems where the environment is fully observable, and the agent can learn by trial and error. Policy gradients have been successfully applied to problems such as robotics and natural language processing.

The policy gradient algorithm is an iterative process that gradually updates the policy parameters to maximize the expected reward. The optimization is done using gradient descent methods, such as stochastic gradient descent.

## Algorithm

One popular class of PG algorithms called REINFORCE algorithms (1992). Common variant:

1. Let the neural network play the game several times and keep calculating the gradients that would make the chosen action more likely - but don’t apply yet.
2. Once you have run several episodes, compute each action’s advantage (+ve for good, -ve for bad).
3. Multiply each gradient vector by the corresponding action’s advantage.
4. Finally compute the mean of all resulting gradient vectors, and use it to perform a Gradient Descent step.
