# Markdown basics

I have taken these tricks from here [FastAi fast Template](https://github.com/fastai/fast_template/blob/master/_posts/2020-01-14-welcome.md).

Here's the table of contents:

1. **Headings**

    We can use "#" symbol for headings, as we increase the no of hashes in the starting, the size of the heading decreases. Heading with one hash symbol is largest and a heading with 6 hash symbols is smalest 

    So,

    # Is largest

    ###### is smallest

2. **Code**

    To represent our code in an text, we uses the "`" back tic symbols. This changes the color of code or commands. It looks more readable. Hence, i suggest to use this back tics always with your code. 

    Like, `print(Hello there)`

    or `sudo /etc/init.d/xrdp restart`

3. **Basic text formatting**

    In markdown format, you can do the basic text formatting like using bold, italics, code font sentences.

    *my name is dsm in italics*

    **my name is dsm in bold**

    `my name is dsm in code font`

4. **Links**

    We can also  add liks in our writings in markdown formats. It is very simple

    Just write `[what appears in writing](you link)` and it will appear in your writing like this [link to heaven](www.google.com).

5. **Lists**

    As every one knows, lists concludes the learning and makes the memoization process easier. And most importantly you can use them in markdown format also.
    There are 2 types of lists, that we can create unordered list and ordered lists.

    This is how you can make these lists: -

    A. Unordered list - to create unordered list use "-" hypen symbol, as shown below

    `my list`
    - my list  

    B. Ordered list - to create ordered lists use counting.

    `1. Number One`

    1. Number one  

6. **Block Quotes**

    To add block quotes in your writing, mark down provides a character for this also. To add a box quotation, you need to write like this,
    `> your quote`

    > Hey my friend  

    and you can add alert messages also, by using javascript, like this

    {% include alert.html text="You can include alert boxes" %} or

    {% include info.html text="You can include info boxes" %}

7. **Images**

    you can add images, in your writing like this.

    `![image description](/path/)`

    ![](/images/Flammarion.jpg)



8. **Code**

    Generally you can format the code in text, by make it inside a box using tab:

        # Do a thing
        do_thing()

    Or you can add python support also to your code, by adding "python" keyword in start of code block. This will not give the output as shown below but it will give you the python language formatting support and it will be helpful in coding fast.

    
    ```python
        # print hello world
        print("Hello world")
    ```

    Output

        Hello world

9. **Tables**

    You can also Create tables in markdown files, by using "|". Example

    ```
    | Column ! | Column 2 |
    |-|-|
    | content | Content |
    ```

    | Column 1 | Column 2 |
    |-|-|
    | A thing | Another thing |

10. **Basic formatting:**

    You can also horizontal lines to your text, like this

    "---"

    ---

    The End
    
    ---
