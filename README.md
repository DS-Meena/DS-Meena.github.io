## How to install Jekyll 🎃

To install Jekyll on Ubuntu, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. First, ensure you have Ruby  installed. If not, you can install it using:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install ruby-full build-essential zlib1g-dev
    ```

    Run following commands to avoid installing gem as root user:
    ```
    echo '# Install Ruby Gems to ~/gems' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'export GEM_HOME="$HOME/gems"' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'export PATH="$HOME/gems/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```

2. Then, install Jekyll and Bundler:

    ```bash
    gem install bundler jekyll
    ```

## Starting a website 🌐

1. Create a Jekyll site.
    ```bash
    jekyll new my-blog
    cd my-blog
    ```

    Or if you already have folder, then try:
    ```
    jekyll new . --force

    ```
    The above command will create a new Jekyll site in the current directory.

2. Install dependencies:
    ```
    bundle install
    ```

3. Start the server.
    ```
    bundle exec jekyll serve
    ```

Your site should now be accessible at http://localhost:4000. Any changes you make to your files will be automatically reflected in the local version of your site, allowing you to preview your blog before pushing changes to GitHub.

## How to add Images 📸

Remember you can't add you images manually inside _site folder, because this folder is automatically generated by Jekyll when you build your site, and its contents are overwritten each time you rebuild.

1. Create an "assets" folder in the root directory of your Jekyll project (not inside _site).
2. Place you images in this folder, and refer here "/assets/clone_repo.png".

```bash
my-jekyll-site/
├── _posts/
│   └── 2023-04-09-Understanding-Git.md
├── assets/
│   └── clone_repo.png
└── _config.yml
```
